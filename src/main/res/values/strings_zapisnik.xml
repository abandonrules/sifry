<h1>Checkpoint Logbook</h1>

<p>You can use this component to log the arrivals, departures, solution etc. in multi–level
puzzlehunt games. All the contents of the logbook are saved between sessions and it is also
possible to export the data for an independent storage or post–processing in an external
application.</p>


<h3>Basic usage</h3>

<p>When approaching a new checkpoint, or entering a new level of a puzzlehunt, click <i>Add
checkpoint</i>. This opens a dialog with pre–filled arrival time and a checkpoint name, defaulting
to \"Checkpoint\" and a ordinal number. Of course, the pre–filled fields can be edited just like
any other ones.</p>

<p>When a puzzle is finished, you can record the time of departure clicking the last added
item in the checkpoint list. A slightly different dialog appears, now allowing to record the
solution of the puzzle and optional comments along with the departure time.</p>

<p>A previously closed checkpoint can also be revisited to review or change any piece of data
associated with it. The full dialog comprises both the arrival– and departure–related fields
together. <i>NB</i> that it is also possible to reveal the full version of the dialog at
arrival using the <i>Unfold</i> button.</p>


<h3>Export</h3>

<p>For the purpose of storage or post–processing, the records can be exported in CSV (comma–separated
values) format using the <i>Export</i> tab. The format used in the export is recognized by all major
spreadsheet editors. You can filter the entries to appear in the exported file.</p>

<p>The file is exported in a folder called \"Puzzlehunt Assistant\" on the default storage device of
your system; for convenience, the name of the newly created file appears for a second. The app also
provides an interface to open the file in some editors installed on your device right after the
export. However, the exported file is stored in the \"Puzzlehunt Assistant\" in either case.</p>


<h3>Preferences</h3>

<p>In the component settings, you can enable or disable the automatic numbering of checkpoints as
\"Checkpoint 1, 2, …\". If the automatic numbering is disabled, newly opened checkpoints will have
no pre–filled name. Even if it is enabled, the pre–filled name can be edited, e.g., to reflect
irregularities in the numbering like \"1A\", \"1B\". When determining the name for a new checkpoint,
the app will look for a first empty slot following the prescribed pattern.</p>


<h3>Tips and tricks</h3>

<p>If you fill in <i>Specification</i> or <i>Remark</i> in the checkpoint details, a \"…\" sign will
appear next to it in the main list. This is a quick indication that there is further information
available which is not readily visible in the overview.</p>
